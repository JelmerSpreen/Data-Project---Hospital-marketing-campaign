# Data-Project---Hospital-marketing-campain

About the project:
Goal project: Creating a Marketing Strategy for targeting hospitals by using multiple linear regression to create an ROI table. 
Situation: 
There are three different account types. Small, medium and big hospitals.  There multiple ways sales are generated.  Such as organic sales but also marketing tactics consisting out of phone, email, flyers and sales visits (in-organic Revenue).
The question is which tactic works better per account?
To answer this question we have to find out what is the impact of each strategy on Sales. Secondly, we need to look if the same strategy is valid for all the different client types?
Libraries needed:
Pandas: for data manipulation
Numpy:  for linear algebra and conditional
Seaborn: for statistical visuals 
Scipy.stats:  to execute  regression
Target variable
Amount collected

Project Summary:
Analyzed marketing campaign impact with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and SciPy. Explored, cleaned, and processed data, converting dates and creating additional features. Conducted client type analysis, correlation analysis, and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Identified impactful variables on amount collected, segmenting the analysis by client types. Produced a consolidated summary of impactful variables per account type, aiding in optimizing marketing strategies. Saved and shared the dataset for future strategy development.
